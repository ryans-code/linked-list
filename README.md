After running 'make,' the executable object called 'LinkedList' will be created. This program takes a command line argument to be used for list size creation.
For example, running './LinkedList 10' will create a list of size 10.
<br />
Failure to supply a command line argument will exit the program.

<br />
Be sure to provide a command line argument with the program.
